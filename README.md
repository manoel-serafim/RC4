# RC4
The provided code is an implementation of the RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4) encryption algorithm. RC4 is a symmetric stream cipher, designed by Ron Rivest in 1987. It's widely used for its simplicity and efficiency in generating a pseudo-random keystream to encrypt and decrypt data.

## RC4 and Its Vulnerabilities:
RC4, while once widely used, is considered insecure for modern cryptography due to several vulnerabilities:

### Weaknesses in Key Scheduling:
The initial permutation of the key state is not strong, and it has vulnerabilities, particularly with weak keys.

### Bias in the Initial Output: 
The initial portion of the keystream can exhibit statistical biases, making it predictable.

### Weakness in Early Keystream Bytes:
The first few bytes of the keystream may reveal information about the key, potentially leading to key recovery.
